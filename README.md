Todo Questions:
1. Robot Problem
2. Using Rand5() design Rand7()
4. Print perimeter of a tree
5. Closest 3sum problem
6. Given text file T and pattern P, find the number of anagrams of 'P' in T; (any ASCII character is a valid literal)
7. Suppose you have a sorted array of integers. Apply a function of the form f(x)=a*x^2 + b*x + c to each element 
	x of the array such that the resulting array is still sorted. Can you do it in better than O(n)
8. Given two n-ary trees how can you check if their structures are same? (Hard problem).
9. Design a game of life matrix: cell of 0's and 1's with conditions: 
	(i) any alive cell with <2 neighbor dies
	(ii) any alive cell with 2-3 neighbors lives
	(iii) any  alive cell with > 3 neighbors dies
	(iv) any dead cell with 3 live neighbors becomes alive
10. Given a array of integers find if there is an element whose sum in the left side == sum in the right side (exclude the element).
	Optimize the soltuions to use O(1) space and O(n) time complexity
11. Given a string return whether there is a permutation that is a palindrome
12. Given a double array find the max product of a subarray (contiguous in original array). [Hint: Kaden's algo]
13. Find the number of primes within internal A and B (A, B large numbers) try to optimize the time complexity to O(B-A) i.e. range.
14. Given a list of nodes (integer values) in inorder traversal, reconstruct a balanced binary tree.
	[Hint: Standard approach O(nlong); can you do it in O(n)? Create empty btree?]
15. Given a singly linked list; Zip it. Zip operation is defined as follows:
	1->2->3->4->5 ==> 1->5->2->4->3 (like a zipper); 1->2->3->4->5->6 ==> 1->6->2->5->3->4
	Notes: Try doing this with O(1) space
16. Find the longest increasing snake in a 2D matrix of integers. Note that you can go in all 8 directions  left right top down and diagonal.
	Return the longest path size. Tip: snake is a increasing subsequence where next elements differs by 1 (consecutive path)
17. Given a huge database with n records (equivalent to n rows), a user has changed k records (k<<n) without remembering which k-s have been
	changed; how to sync the database without transmitiing the entire database.
