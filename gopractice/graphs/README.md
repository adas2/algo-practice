# Graph problems

## Solved
1. Find connected components in a graph (BST traversal)
2. Dijkstra
3. Strongly Connected Component (Kosaraju's algo)
4. Bellman Ford
5. Topological sort (using Kahns algo)


## Todo
1. MST impl (similar to Dijkstra; keep parent array for tree traversal)
3. If a directed graph is cyclic (DFS use case)
5. MST for a directected graph (Kruskal and Prim fails)
