# String Problems
Generic algos/problems on strings and solutions in Golang.
Includes problems on word matching, dict manipulation, regexp processing

## Solved
1. Rabin Karp based pattern matching (with rolling hash impl)
2. Boggle game:  Given a grid of letters you can form words by traversing only 
   adjacent grid letters;
   given a dictionary of words, find which words formed from the grid are a match
   E.g. for input grid 
   ```
   T I P
   O Y G
   N S K
   ``` 
   given english dictionary matches are:
   `{TO, TON, TONS, TIP, TOY, TOYS}`
3. Palindrome pairs [LC #336]
4. Valid Paranthesis
5. String permuations
6. String shifting groups: "abc" --> "bcd"


## Todos
1. K-similarity of strings
