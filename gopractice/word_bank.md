Problem: Create a effcicient data structure to support the following operations:

Statement Text:  "Year 2020 starts a new decade; it's the third decade of this millenium. Decade is a ten year-long period, while millenium is 1000 year-long period. Millenium will end in the year 2999."

A. Find the most frequent word(s) in the given text. If multiple return all words. E.g. ["millenium", "decade"]

B. Given a string find is that word exists in your data structure. Note: The given string might not be a dictionary word. E.g. "year" return "exists"; "century" returns doesn't not exist

C. If the above string doesn't belong to the word base, find if it is a substring of any word; if so return the word. If nothing matches, return "no match". E.g. searching "mill" returns the word "millenium"
